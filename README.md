# ts-node-starter
Typescript node boilerplate project set up how I like it:

- Node 14; version enforced via package.json and npmrc
- Typescript 4 and Node 14 compliant tsconfig 
- nvmrc for nvm users
- Jest, ts-jest and typed jest config
- [xo](https://github.com/xojs/xo) for linting. To use as VSCode formatter, [install it](https://github.com/xojs/vscode-linter-xo) and set it as your default formatter
- Webpack 5 with ts-loader and [fork-ts-checker](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin) for production-ready speedy builds
